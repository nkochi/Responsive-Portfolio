      <img src="./pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Noora Kochi" style="width:120px;height:120px;">

      <p>My name is Noora Kochi. I am from Fremont, CA. I went to California State University at Hayward and now it is know as
        Cal State at East Bay. I moved to Arizona back in 2005 when I got married. I have an MIS degree and have been out
        of the IT field for a few years. I am going through this bootcamp so I am able to get a job in the IT field again.</p>
      <p> I have two beatiful girls and they mean the world to me. My oldest daughter is eight years old and she is in third grade.
        My second daughter is only two years but she acts like a grown woman. They both are the opposite. The oldest likes
        to eat cake and doesn't like the frosting but the youngest doesn't like cake but lovees frosting.</p>
